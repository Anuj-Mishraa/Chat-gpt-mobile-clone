## Just a chat gpt clone made with python Kivy-gui
<p>
I have created a ChatGPT clone using Kivy and Python. Kivy is an open-source Python library that is used to develop multi-touch applications. With this clone, you can chat with a language model trained on a large corpus of text, just like the real ChatGPT.
